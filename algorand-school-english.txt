BLOCKCHAIN AS INFRASTRUCTUREFor native digital value

Blockchain is a digital infrastructure for value
5
"The ability to create something which is not duplicable in the digital world has enormous value."

Eric Schmidt

SECURITY (INT/EXT)

Public or private? Who has the control? Duty and responsibility? Aligned incentives?


The problem of native digital value
7
In the digital age
everything can be represented in bits 
as a string of 0 and 1
Strings of 0 and 1 are useful
because you can
duplicate them easily
Value is therefore difficult to represent in the digital age:
SCARCITY, AUTHENTICITY, UNICITY


How to build such infrastructure? Protocol is the answer
8
Just like TCP/IP is the foundational protocol for the modern Internet infrastructure, we will solve the problem through an protocol.

This is not just an information technology problem

ANALOG PROPERTIES
FOR DIGITAL THINGS
Consensus as “law of Physics” for digital world

Who owns what? Let’s write it down!
14
A blockchain is a public ledger of transactional data.
World's first writing — cuneiform — traces its beginnings back to an ancient system of accounting.

WHAT
Writing systems: from prehistory to history of humankind.

More copies are better than one!
15
Distributed and replicated across a system of multiple nodes in a network.
All “ledger keepers” should work together, using the same set rules, to verify the transactions to add to each copy of the finalized ledger. 


16
Atoms can’t be copy & pasted and are obliged to follow the arrow of time!
Bits can be copy & pasted and are not obliged to follow the arrow of time!
Entropy, irreversibility and the arrow of time
In a distributed system is hard to ensure that the information follows a consequential time. Also, the arrow of time could bypassed reverting transactions. The ledger of information must respect a precise history and must not allow arbitrary creation, duplication or deletion of information. 

A chain of transactions organized in blocks
17
The “block” refers to a set of transactions that are proposed and verified by the other nodes and eventually added to the ledger (no copy & paste).
The “chain” refers to the fact that each block of transactions contains proof (a cryptographic hash) of what was in the previous block (arrow of time).





Can transactions be reverted or modified ex-post? No! Dura lex, sed lex!

Temple of Concordia
Valley of Temples (Agrigento), 440-430 B.C.
How to choose the proposer for the next block for a public and permissionless blockchain?

How to ensure that there is no ambiguity in the choice of the next block?

How to ensure that the blockchain stays unique and has no forks?

How to ensure that consensus mechanism itself can evolve over time while the blockchain is an immutable ledger?
It is the largest and best-preserved Doric temple in Sicily[5] and one of the best-preserved Greek temples in general,[1] especially of the Doric order. Named after Concordia.
In ancient Roman religion, Concordia is the goddess who embodies agreement in society. Her Greek equivalent is usually regarded as Harmonia, with musical harmony a metaphor for an ideal of social concord.
This tells us a lot about the value of such a civilization!

Proof of Work consensus mechanism
21
Miners compete with each other to append the next block and earn a reward for the effort, fighting to win an expensive computational battle.
The more computational power, the higher the probability of being elected as block proposer.
PoW


Proof of Work limits
22
Huge electrical consumption

Concentration of governance in few mining farms

Soft-forking of the blockchain


Proof of Stake consensus mechanism
23
Network participants show their commitment and interest in keeping the ledger safe and secure proving the ownership of value stored on the ledger itself.

The higher the skin in the game the higher the probability of being elected as block proposer.


Proof of Stake limits
24
CRITICAL ISSUES
BONDED PROOF OF STAKE
Validators bind their stake, to show their commitment in validating and appending a new block. Misbehaviors are punished.
Participating in the consensus protocol makes users’ stakes illiquid
Risk of economic barrier to entry
DELEGATED PROOF OF STAKE
Users delegate the validation of new blocks to a fixed committee, through weighted voting based on their stakes.
Known delegate nodes, therefore exposed to DDoS attacks
Centralization of governance
BPoS
DPoS
It’s like playing Battleship knowing the coordinates of adversary in advance.

Tamper-proof, unique and verifiable dices
28





VRF
Dices are perfectly balanced and equiprobable, nobody could tamper their result!
Keep observing dice rolls by no means increases the chance of guessing the next result!
Each dice is uniquely signed by its owner, nobody can roll someone else dices!
Dices are publicly verifiable, everybody can read the results of a roll!


Who chose the next block?
29

WIN!
Each ALGO could be assimilated to a tamper-proof dice participating in a safe and secret cryptographic dice roll. More ALGOs more dices to roll.

For each new block, dice rolls are performed in a distributed, parallel and secret and manner, directly on online accounts’ hardware (in microseconds).

The winner is revealed in a safe and verifiable way only after winning the dice roll, proposing the next block.


A glimpse on “simplified” VRF sortition
30
A secret key (SK) / public verification key (VK) pair is associated with each ALGO in the account
For each new round r of the consensus protocol a threshold L(r) is defined
Each ALGO in the account performs a VRF, using its own secret key (SK), to generate:
a pseudo-random number:		Y = VRFSK(seed)
the verifiable associated proof:	⍴SK(seed)
If Y = VRFSK(seed) < L(r), that specific ALGO “wins the lottery” and viraly propagates the proof of its victory ⍴SK(seed) to other network’s nodes, through “gossiping” mechanism
Others node can use the public verification key (VK) to verify, through ⍴SK(seed), that the number Y was generated by that specific ALGO, owned by the winner of the lottery


Pure Proof of Stake, in short
31
Through the cryptographic lottery, an online account is elected with probability directly proportional to its stake: each ALGO corresponds to an attempt to win the lottery!




An account is elected to propose the next block
A committee is elected to filter and vote on the block proposals
A new committee is elected to reach a quorum and certify the block
The new block is appended to the blockchain
Each round of the consensus protocol appends a new block in the blockchain:


Pure Proof of Stake security
32
Algorand’s decentralized Byzantine consensus protocol can tolerate an arbitrary number of malicious users as long as honest users hold a super majority of the total stake in the system.
The adversary does not know which users he should corrupt.
The adversary realizes which users are selected too late to benefit from attacking them. 
Each new set of users will be privately and individually elected.
During a network partition in Algorand, the adversary is never able to convince two honest users to accept two different blocks for the same round.
Algorand is able to recover shortly after network partition is resolved and guarantees that new blocks will be generated at the same speed as before the partition.


Pure Proof of Stake: the output!

ALGORAND SUSTAINABILITY“Permission-less” is not “Responsibility-less”

Proof of unsustainable Work
38
Proof of Work is a planetary wasteful computational battle, in which miners MUST burn energy to secure the blockchain.
Showing off personal commitment in the ecosystem through the consumption of computational and energetic resources is at the core of PoW consensus mechanism.

Our planet Earth can no longer afford unsustainable technologies.

Is Algorand blockchain efficient
at consuming energy 
to finalize end user useful transactions
in a secure, scalable and decentralized way?


Algorand solves blockchain trilemma sustainably
43
Algorand transactions are 100% available to end-users
(other PoS blockchains consume their own transactions for consensus)
Algorand transactions are 100% instantly final
(other PoS must consume the energy of several blocks to ensure transactions’ finality)
Algorand transactions are secured by a very decentralized network
(some PoS blockchain have only few validators)
Algorand security is a feature of its own efficiency
(Algorand never experienced downtime since the genesis block)

Access to Algorand Network
The Algorand blockchain is a distributed system of nodes each maintaining their local state based on validating the history of blocks and the transactions therein. Blockchain state integrity is maintained by the consensus protocol which is implemented within the Algod daemon (often referred to as the node software).

An application connects to the Algorand blockchain through an Algod client, requiring:

a valid Algod REST API endpoint IP address
an Algod token from an Algorand node connected to the network you plan to interact with

These two pieces of information can be provided by your local node or by a third party node aaS.


51
How to get an Algod Client?
There are three ways to get a REST API Algod endpoint IP address / access token, each with their respective pros and cons depending on development goals.

ALGORAND INTEROPERABILITYState Proofs and Post-Quantum Security
Credits to Noah Grossman for contens

Trustless interoperability
62
Algorand approach to interoperability:
cross-chain transactions should rely just on
Trust in departing consensus protocol
Trust in arrival consensus protocol
without centralized bridges or validator networks, to handle the assets.

Algorand State Proofs remove trusted centralized operators becoming the first trustless post-quantum secure L1 interoperability standard.


Post-Quantum Secure Algorand State Proofs
63
Post-Quantum secure and immutable proofs, attesting blockchain state, generated by Pure Proof of Stake consensus protocol.


64
ALGORAND TRANSACTIONS
Core element of blocks

Changing blockchain state
65
Transactions are the core element of blocks, which define the evolution of distributed ledger state. There are six transaction types in the Algorand Protocol:
Payment
Key Registration
Asset Configuration
Asset Freeze
Asset Transfer
Application Call

These six transaction types can be specified in particular ways that result in more granular perceived transaction types.


Signature, fees and round validity
66
In order to be approved, Algorand’s transactions must comply with:

Signatures: transactions must be correctly signed by its sender, either a Single Signature, a Multi Signature or a Smart Signature / Smart Contract
Fees: in Algorand transactions fees are a way to protect the network from DDoS. In Algorand Pure PoS fees are not meant to pay “validation” (as it happens in PoW blockchains). In Algorand you can delegate fees.
Round validity: to handle transactions’ idempotency, letting Non-Archival nodes participate in Algorand Consensus, transactions have an intrinsic validity of 1000 blocks (at most). 


Browse through a transaction
67
Transactions are characterized by two kind of fields (codec):

common (header)
specific (type)


Payment Transaction example

Here is a transaction that sends 5 ALGO from one account to another on MainNet.

ADDRESS: the public key is transformed into an Algorand Address, by adding a 4-byte checksum to the end of the public key and then encoding it in base32.

MNEMONIC: the 25-word mnemonic is generated by converting the private key bytes into 11-bit integers and then mapping those integers to the bip-0039 English word list.


Algorand Accounts
71
Accounts are entities on the Algorand blockchain associated with specific on-chain local sate. An Algorand Address is the unique identifier for an Algorand Account.
All the potential keys pairs “already exists” mathematically, we just keep discovering them.

ALGORAND VIRTUAL MACHINE (AVM)Programming on Algorand

What’s a Smart Contract ?
75
Smart Contracts are deterministic programs through which complex decentralized trustless applications can be executed on the AVM.
The Algorand Virtual Machine is a Turing-complete secure execution environment that runs on Algorand consensus layer.
What’s the AVM ?


Algorand Virtual Machine purpose: approving or rejecting transactions’ effects on the blockchain according to Smart Contracts’ logic.
What the AVM actually does?
76
AVM approves transactions’ effects if and only if:
There is a single non-zero value on top of AVM’s stack;
AVM rejects transactions’ effects if and only if:
There is a single zero value on top of AVM’s stack;
There are multiple values on the AVM’s stack;
There is no value on the AVM’s stack;

TEALAVM assembly-like language

Smart Signature Example
101
Suppose we want to develop a Smart Signature that approves a transaction if and only if:

is “Payment” type transaction;
the receiver is a specific “ADDR”;
fees are less or equal to “1000 microALGO”;
first argument is equal to “bianconiglio”;
amount is  equal to “42 ALGO”;
or amount is equal to “77 ALGO”;

Where do we start?


Smart Signature as “Transaction Observer”
102
Smart Signatures can be defined as a “transactions’ observers”: programs that meticulously check all fields in the transaction (or in a group of transactions) that intend to “approve” or “reject” based on TEAL logic.

To translate those 6 semantically defined example’s conditions into TEAL we need to check which transaction fields are going to be controlled by Smart Signature’s logic.



Let's start with the translation...

This is probably the most complex phase in TEAL programming, because you need to keep in mind the state of the stack.

This phase is drastically simplified with the use of PyTEAL, Python binding for TEAL, which automatically performs this concatenation, saving us the effort of thinking about the state of the stack.

PyTEALWriting Smart Contracts with Python
Credits to Jason Paulos for the PyTEAL presentation

What’s PyTEAL?
147
PyTEAL is a Python language binding for Algorand Virtual Machine.
PyTEAL allows Smart Contracts and Smart Signatures to be written in Python and then compiled to TEAL.

Smart Signature written in PyTEAL


PyTEAL Basics - Intro
150
PyTEAL expressions represent an abstract syntax tree (AST)
You’re writing Python code that produces TEAL code.
from pyteal import *

program = ...
teal_source = compileTeal(program, mode=Mode.Application, version=5)


PyTEAL Basics - Types (1/2)
151
Two basic types:
uint64
byte strings
i = Int(5)
x = Bytes("content")
y = Bytes(b"\x01\x02\x03")
z = Bytes("base16", "05")


PyTEAL Basics - Types (2/2)
152
Conversion between types
Itob - integer to bytes (8-byte big endian)
Btoi - bytes to integer
Itob(i) # produces the byte string 0x0000000000000005
Btoi(z) # produces the integer 5


PyTEAL Basics - Math operators
153
Python math operators
i = Int(10)
j = i * Int(2) + Int(1)
k = And(Int(1), Or(Int(1), Int(0)))


PyTEAL Basics - Byte string manipulation
154
Byte string manipulation
x = Bytes("content")
y = Concat(Bytes("example "), x) # "example content"
z = Substring(y, Int(2), Len(y)) # "ample content"


PyTEAL Basics - Crypto utilities
155
Built-in crypto utilities
h_sha256 = Sha256(z)
h_sha512_256 = Sha512_256(z)
h_keccak = Keccak256(z)


PyTEAL Basics - Fields (1/3)
156
Fields from the current transaction
Txn.sender()
Txn.accounts.length()
Txn.application_args.length()
Txn.accounts[1]
Txn.application_args[0]
Txn.group_index()


PyTEAL Basics - Fields (2/3)
157
Fields from transactions in the current atomic group
Gtxn[0].sender()
Gtxn[Txn.group_index() - Int(1)].sender()
Gtxn[Txn.group_index() - Int(1)].accounts[2]


PyTEAL Basics - Fields (3/3)
158
Fields from execution context
Global.group_size()
Global.round() # current round number
Global.latest_timestamp() # UNIX timestamp of last round


PyTEAL Basics - Logs
159
Log publicly viewable messages to the chain
	Log(Bytes("message"))


PyTEAL Basics - State (1/2)
160
Global - one instance per application
App.globalPut(Bytes("status"), Bytes("active")) # write to global key "status"

status = App.globalGet(Bytes("status")) # read global key "status"

App.globalDel(Bytes("status")) # delete global key "status"


PyTEAL Basics - State (2/2)
161
Local - one instance per opted-in account per application
App.localPut(Txn.sender(), Bytes("level"), Int(1)) # write to sender's local key "level"
App.localPut(Txn.accounts[1], Bytes("level"), Int(2))  # write to other account's local key "level"

sender_level = App.localGet(Txn.sender(), Bytes("level"))  # read from sender's local key "level"

App.localDel(Txn.sender(), Bytes("level"))  # delete sender's local key "level"


PyTEAL Basics - Control Flow (1/5)
162
Approve the transaction and immediately exit
Approve()
Reject the transaction and immediately exit
Reject()


PyTEAL Basics - Control Flow (2/5)
163
Multiple expressions can be joined into a sequence
program = Seq(
   App.globalPut(Bytes("count"), App.globalGet(Bytes("count")) + Int(1)),
   Approve()
)


PyTEAL Basics - Control Flow (3/5)
164
Basic conditions can be expressed with If, Then, Else, ElseIf
program = Seq(
   If(App.globalGet(Bytes("count")) == Int(100))
   .Then(
       App.globalPut(Bytes("100th caller"), Txn.sender())
   )
   .Else(
       App.globalPut(Bytes("not 100th caller"), Txn.sender())
   ),
   App.globalPut(Bytes("count"), App.globalGet(Bytes("count")) + Int(1)),
   Approve(),
)


PyTEAL Basics - Control Flow (4/5)
165
Larger conditions can be expressed with Cond
program = Cond(
   [Txn.application_id() == Int(0), on_create],
   [Txn.on_completion() == OnComplete.UpdateApplication, on_update],
   [Txn.on_completion() == OnComplete.DeleteApplication, on_delete],
   [Txn.on_completion() == OnComplete.OptIn, on_opt_in],
   [Txn.on_completion() == OnComplete.CloseOut, on_close_out],
   [Txn.on_completion() == OnComplete.NoOp, on_noop],
   # error if no conditions are met
)


PyTEAL Basics - Control Flow (5/5)
166
Loops can be expressed with For and While
i = ScratchVar(TealType.uint64)

on_create = Seq(
   For(i.store(Int(0)), i.load() < Int(16), i.store(i.load() + Int(1)))
   .Do(
       App.globalPut(Concat(Bytes("index"), Itob(i.load())), Int(1))
   ),
   Approve(),
)


PyTEAL Basics - Subroutines (1/2)
167
Sections of code can be put into subroutines (Python decorators)
@Subroutine(TealType.uint64)
def isEven(i):
   return i % Int(2) == Int(0)

App.globalPut(Bytes("value_is_even"), isEven(Int(10)))


PyTEAL Basics - Subroutines (2/2)
168
Recursion is allowed
@Subroutine(TealType.uint64)
def recursiveIsEven(i):
   return (
       If(i == Int(0))
       .Then(Int(1))
       .ElseIf(i == Int(1))
       .Then(Int(0))
       .Else(recursiveIsEven(i - Int(2)))
   )


PyTEAL Basics - Inner Transactions (1/3)
169
Every application has control of an account
Global.current_application_address()


PyTEAL Basics - Inner Transactions (2/3)
170
Applications can send transactions from this account
Seq(
   InnerTxnBuilder.Begin(),
   InnerTxnBuilder.SetFields(
       {
           TxnField.type_enum: TxnType.Payment,
           TxnField.receiver: Txn.sender(),
           TxnField.amount: Int(1_000_000),
       }
   ),
   InnerTxnBuilder.Submit() # send 1 Algo from the app account to the transaction sender
)


PyTEAL Basics - Inner Transactions (3/3)
171
appAddr = Global.current_application_address()
Seq(
   InnerTxnBuilder.Begin(),
   InnerTxnBuilder.SetFields(
       {
           TxnField.type_enum: TxnType.AssetConfig,
           TxnField.config_asset_name: Bytes("PyTEAL Coin"),
           TxnField.config_asset_unit_name: Bytes("PyTEAL"),
           TxnField.config_asset_url: Bytes("https://pyteal.readthedocs.io/"),
           TxnField.config_asset_decimals: Int(6),
           TxnField.config_asset_total: Int(800_000_000),
           TxnField.config_asset_manager: appAddr,
       }
   ),
   InnerTxnBuilder.Submit(), # create a PyTEAL Coin asset
   App.globalPut(Bytes("PyTealCoinId"), InnerTxn.created_asset_id()) # remember the asset ID
)
